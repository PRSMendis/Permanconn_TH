# Instructions

This is a coding exercise for the Software Engineer role at Permaconn.
The exercise should be relatively fast to complete. We are expecting no more than a few hours to complete the test.  
To return the test, store the code and related documentation on Github for easy access.
Please send the following information over email:

1. Link to Github repository
2. If you ran out of time and you are returning a partial solution, description
   of what is missing and how you would continue

Your code will only be used for the evaluation.

Exercise:
Create a webpage that shows a list of Products with the ability to add a new product and edit existing products. The user should have authorised access to add or edit products.
The frontend should be in React and all the data has to be served through an API backend using ExpressJs framework in NodeJs

Steps I will do this in:

1. Create a rudimentary frontend and backend and connect them
2. Make sure I can get all the products and display them
3. Add auth
4. Create add and edit endpoints, and tie them into the frontend

Use dummy api's from https://dummyjson.com/docs/products for all actions

Bonus:

1. Ability to dockerise the code
2. Tests included in the API backend code
3. Search from the list of products
